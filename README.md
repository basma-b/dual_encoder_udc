# dual_encoder_udc
An implementation of dual encoder using Keras

In this repository I implemented the dual encoder used in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08909.pdf using Keras. The motivation of this work is that the available implementations of this work are in Theano https://github.com/npow/ubottu and Tensorflow https://github.com/dennybritz/chatbot-retrieval/ 

I think that both implementations are hard to understand and to re-use (my point of view) so I decided to implement a simple code using Keras.

## Requires:
* Python 2.7
* Theano
* Keras

## Running the model:
```
python dual_encoder.py
```
